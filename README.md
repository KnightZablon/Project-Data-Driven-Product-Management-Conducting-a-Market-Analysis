# Project-Data-Driven-Product-Management-Conducting-a-Market-Analysis

In this project, I worked as a product manager for a fitness studio and aimed to understand the current demand for digital fitness classes. To do this, I planned a market analysis using data from Google Trends, provided in several CSV files. These files contained both global and regional data on searches for fitness-related keywords such as "workout," "home workout," "gym workout," and "home gym," as well as data segmented by country and time period.

Steps I Took:
Analyzing Global Search Trends: I started by loading the global data on the keyword "workout" from the workout.csv file. This data included monthly search popularity indexed on a scale of 0 to 100. I created a time series plot to identify the peak in global interest for the keyword "workout" across the months, helping me understand when interest was highest. The plot also provided insights into the long-term trend of workout-related searches.

Investigating Keyword Popularity During COVID-19: Next, I turned to the three_keywords.csv file, which contained data on the popularity of three specific keywords: "home workout," "gym workout," and "home gym." I plotted these keywords over time to observe how interest in home-based fitness (like "home workout" and "home gym") surged during the pandemic, as well as how it compared to interest in traditional gym workouts. This helped me understand how the pandemic influenced fitness trends and which types of workouts had the highest demand.

Identifying Peak Keyword Interest During COVID-19: I identified the keyword "home workout" as the peak of interest during the pandemic, which aligns with the rise of remote fitness solutions. At the same time, I noted that "gym workout" was currently the most popular keyword, reflecting a shift back to gym-based activities as restrictions eased.

Assessing Country-Specific Trends: I examined the workout_geo.csv file to identify which countries had the highest interest in the keyword "workout" over the last five years. Through this analysis, I found that the United States had the highest interest, followed by Australia and Japan, with Japan showing significantly lower interest. This insight could help me identify where the fitness studio could focus its marketing efforts or expand its digital services based on regional demand.

Comparing Interest in Home Workouts Between Countries: Lastly, I used the three_keywords_geo.csv file to compare interest in home workouts between the Philippines and Malaysia. This regional comparison showed that the Philippines had a slightly higher interest in "home workout" than Malaysia, providing me with insights into which country could be a better target for launching digital fitness products or services.

Outcome:
Through these steps, I was able to gather a comprehensive understanding of global and regional demand for digital fitness classes, especially in response to COVID-19. The analysis highlighted key trends, such as the surge in home-based fitness workouts during the pandemic and the continued interest in gym-based workouts. Additionally, country-specific insights informed decisions about where to focus marketing and digital product development efforts. This market analysis will guide the fitness studio in offering targeted digital services and tailoring its offerings to meet the growing demand in key regions.
